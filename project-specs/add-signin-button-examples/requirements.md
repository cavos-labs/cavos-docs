# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the cavos-docs documentation site by integrating live, interactive examples of Google and Apple sign-in buttons from the cavos-service-sdk. The primary goal is to provide developers with immediate visual feedback and working examples of these authentication components, making it easier to understand their functionality and implementation before integrating them into their own projects.

The feature emphasizes an extremely simple approach, focusing on minimal configuration and clear, copy-paste examples that work out of the box. This will reduce the learning curve and increase developer adoption of the Cavos authentication services by providing tangible, interactive demonstrations within the documentation itself.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive Google Sign-In Button Integration
**User Story:** As a developer reading the documentation, I want to see a working Google sign-in button example, so that I can understand how it looks and behaves before implementing it in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a developer visits the authentication documentation page THEN the system SHALL display a functional Google sign-in button from cavos-service-sdk
2. WHEN the Google sign-in button is clicked THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the authentication flow (even if non-functional in docs context)
3. WHEN viewing the button example THEN the system SHALL provide the corresponding code snippet below the interactive component
4. IF the authentication flow cannot complete in the docs environment THEN the system SHALL show appropriate feedback messages explaining the limitation

### Requirement 2: Interactive Apple Sign-In Button Integration
**User Story:** As a developer evaluating authentication options, I want to see a working Apple sign-in button example, so that I can compare it with other authentication methods and understand its implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a developer visits the authentication documentation page THEN the system SHALL display a functional Apple sign-in button from cavos-service-sdk
2. WHEN the Apple sign-in button is clicked THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the authentication flow (even if non-functional in docs context)
3. WHEN viewing the button example THEN the system SHALL provide the corresponding code snippet below the interactive component
4. IF the authentication flow cannot complete in the docs environment THEN the system SHALL show appropriate feedback messages explaining the limitation

### Requirement 3: Minimal Configuration Approach
**User Story:** As a developer new to Cavos services, I want the button examples to use minimal configuration, so that I can quickly understand the essential implementation without being overwhelmed by complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN implementing the button examples THEN the system SHALL use the absolute minimum required props and configuration
2. WHEN displaying code examples THEN the system SHALL show only essential parameters and omit optional configurations
3. WHEN a developer copies the example code THEN the system SHALL ensure it works with minimal modifications in their own project
4. IF complex configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL link to detailed configuration documentation rather than inline complexity

### Requirement 4: Documentation Integration
**User Story:** As a developer browsing the documentation, I want the sign-in button examples to fit naturally within the existing documentation structure, so that my reading flow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the sign-in buttons are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them into existing authentication documentation pages
2. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain the current visual design and layout consistency
3. WHEN examples are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the existing code example formatting patterns
4. WHILE browsing different documentation sections THE system SHALL ensure button examples don't interfere with other content

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback
**User Story:** As a developer testing the button examples, I want clear feedback when authentication cannot complete, so that I understand the limitations of the documentation environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN authentication flows are initiated in the docs environment THEN the system SHALL provide clear messaging about documentation context limitations
2. WHEN errors occur during button interaction THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. IF authentication cannot complete THEN the system SHALL explain next steps for implementation in a real application
4. WHEN buttons are non-functional due to configuration THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this is expected behavior in documentation
